<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>Working in scrum teams was an exercise that I not
only found beneficial, but one I would like to continue throughout my
professional career. My scrum team allowed me to see issues that I had not
previously noticed, they taught me new things, and they gave me different
perspectives other than my own. The kinds of questions I brought to my group
that allowed these things to happen were: what do you think of my layout? Do you
like my navigation bar? Do these colors work well together? How did you get
your layout to look like that? With these questions, they not only helped me,
but I helped them with what I knew that they did not. This entire process was
extensive in learning, so without one another, we would not have learned or
accomplished as much as we did. Through supporting and learning with one
another, we were able to learn how to create and link out our home, portfolio,
resume, and contact pages, how to have a horizontal navigation bar, and how to
organize all of the moving parts (divs, headings, etc.) in the html and css. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>All time spent in the workshops was used
effectively. Each time we had a workshop, I left class with something
additional accomplished that I had not had done before. When I could not figure
out how to do something in codecademy, codepen, or google, I would save it for
when I was meeting with my scrum team to see if they could help me, which they
always did. I did spend most of my time working on my portfolio outside of
class so I could absorb, take notes, and learn during class. I would experiment
often on codepen so I could see if a code would work or not and I would refer
back to codecademy for principles that I was unsure of. Some of the goals I set
for myself were to not only finish my website and portfolio, but to finish it
well and understand what I was doing. There were times where I was extremely
frustrated and wanted to give up, but I did not. I knew that making a decent
portfolio was going to take time and patience, so that’s what I gave it. I do
wish that I would have dedicated more time in the beginning rather than being
overwhelmed and putting it off. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>I got a lot of support from my scrum team, I got
support from codepen, and I got support from researching. A website I visited a
lot was <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a> and www.kelseymclark.com.
The w3schools website is a website that has everything html and everything css
that one could possibly want. It has a list of every attribute, a list of every
tag, and so on and so forth. The www.kelseymclark.com website is a professional
writing alumni portfolio that provided me with a lot of design inspiration as
well as what professional information I wanted to include. I also consulted
google a lot as well as a tutor. It was a lot for me to admit that making this
was going to be a major challenge, but I was able to get past that and seek
help when I needed it. </span></p>
