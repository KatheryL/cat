<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>The process of converting the rough material of my
design ideas (sketches) into a visually comprehensive product (Photoshop
designed pictures of different page views), to actually coding has been
everything but easy. I began, like the rest of my class, by learning about HTML
and CSS through the class readings, discussions, and Codecademy. At first, it
was extremely overwhelming. As time went on, I began to produce my own code
through Codecademy and then Codepen. For the most part, I have used Codepen,
which has allowed me to plug in codes simply to see how they are going to look
on the page. The content I have produced in Codepen is fairly basic and simple,
but it actually has a lot of work within it. In regards to the presentation
aspect, I am starting to better understand and therefore play with the CSS of
my page. I have enjoyed experimenting with colors, margin widths, and the
overall layout of my page. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>The strategies that I have implemented to separate
my content from my presentation have been fairly experimental, especially with
the CSS. For the main HTML content, I have followed the layout of HTML
structure: doctype, html, header, linking to css, body, paragraphs, a nav bar,
etc. laying out the HTML has been the easy part, for the challenges that have arose
have come from positioning boxes appropriately within CSS. For example, it took
probably forty five minutes and some yelling to get my navigation bar where I
wanted it. Most of my strategy for my portfolio has been plug and chug with
trial and error, where I simply try things and see if they work. From the
design docs, I had an idea of what I wanted my website to look like; I just
needed to figure out how to do it. Figuring out how to create content from my
designs and then present it in an appropriate form has been a journey, but I’m
overall pleased with how the code is translating. The most valuable lesson I
have learned is that everything takes time and most importantly structure,
without the structure there can’t be anything pretty or exciting. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>I still have a decent amount of coding and
presenting to go through before my website is ready. A shortcoming that I can’t
seem to understand is the time commitment of building a website and building it
well. This process has been something that takes not only time, but effort,
patience, and planning. I have found that I can’t just throw it together and
get something cohesive, I have to actually refer back to my wireframes and
design docs then recall codes to ensure the pages turn out how I want them to. To
improve the remainder of my website composition process, I will recall the
notes and codes that I have learned, dedicate more time to create the designs
that I want and be patient with what I’m trying to do. </span></p>
