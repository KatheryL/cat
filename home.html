  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <img src="klogo.jpg" alt="katheryn"/>
  <p>Katheryn here. A professional writing major who has a love for long walks on the beach, romantic comedies, and Christmas time. Writing, talking, exercising, and sleeping are pretty much what my life revolves around.  
  I plan to do big things with my life, although I'm not quite sure what those big things will be yet. I live by the mottoes, "know who you are and do it on purpose" and "live and let live." 
  I think cliches are fun, highly underrated, and a great way to express your thoughts. 
  Thought expression is something I will forever be grateful to Michigan State University for. It is somewhere close to Heaven, bringing me closer and closer to my goals everyday, showing me beautiful things I've never seen on a daily basis 
  and forcing me to challenge myself in ways I didn't know possible.</p>
